    <h1>Learn OpenFlow</h1>
    <p>
    Now you can learn OpenFlow using a simple web browser. Flowsim is
    designed to simulate a wide range of standards compliant OpenFlow 
    switch profiles. Choose a profile from any version of OpenFlow, or 
    customize your own profiles. Watch packets step through the OpenFlow
    switch data plane's pipeline stages and learn exactly what is
    happening.

      <h2>Ports</h2>
      <p>
      Ports are a fundamental abstraction in the OpenFlow protocol. Mimic 
      actual vendor switches with specific port counts and capabilities.
      Toggle port status during simulation to see port state changes and
      related OpenFlow messaging.

      <h2>Classifiers</h2>
      <p>
      Classifiers are OpenFlow's fundamental packet matching mechanism.
      Limit a switch's possible classifiers through a profile. Learn the
      details of multi-table flow matching by single steping a packet
      through the classification, or flow matching stage, of the OpenFlow
      data plane pipeline.

      <h2>Policies</h2>
      <p>
      Limit a switch's possible policies through instruction and action
      capabilities on a profile. Learn the intracacies of instructions and
      actions by watching them in action. See how a packet is manipulated
      based on different instruction and action combinations.
